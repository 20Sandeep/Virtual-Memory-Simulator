# Virtual Page Replacement Simulator

##  Overview
The **Virtual Page Replacement Simulator** is a full-stack web application designed to simulate and visualize **page replacement algorithms** used in Operating Systems.  
It serves as an **educational tool** to help students and learners understand how memory management works with algorithms like **FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and Clock**.

Users can input a reference string and frame count, select an algorithm, and view a **step-by-step animated simulation** with **hit/miss statistics** and **comparative performance graphs**.
